{"name":"Object-oriented Programming in JavaScript","description":"What is Object-oriented Programming (OOP)?\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm or style of programming. It’s been around since ‘70s, but unlike tools and frameworks that come and go, OOP is still very relevant today. That’s because it’s not a programming language or a tool. It’s a style of programming.\n\n\n\nWhy learn OOP?\n\nOOP helps you manage and reduce complexity in software by building re-usable building blocks (objects). Properly designed objects provide a simple interface and hide the unnecessary complexity from the outside, just like a DVD player! A DVD player has a complex logic board on the inside and a few buttons on the outside. When you press the play button, you don’t care how all those microchips talk to each other.\n\n\n\nObject-oriented programming helps you:\n\nManage and reduce complexity\nEliminate redundant code\nBuild re-usable building blocks\nWrite cleaner code\n\n\nAn essential skills for every developer\n\nOOP comes up in many technical interviews. So if you really want to be a serious developer, you need to understand object-oriented programming. As a technical interviewer myself, if I see a candidate with OOP on their resume, that candidate stands out to me. \n\nIt may interest you to know that many of the popular frameworks out there that you might be using are actually designed with OOP concepts in mind. Angular is an example of such frameworks!

You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.\n\nBut using JavaScript can be challenging - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.\n\nReact to the rescue! \n\nReact is all about components - basically custom HTML elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.\n\nNeed to display a list of users in your app? It's as simple as creating a \"User\" component and outputting it as often as needed.\n\nThis course will start at the very basics and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way from basic to advanced. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux. \n\nBy the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page) applications!","rating":4.6,"reviews":3674,"studentsRegistered":15077,"durationHours":3.5,"level":"INTERMEDIATE","imgUrl":"https://i.udemycdn.com/course/240x135/922484_52a1_7.jpg","courseStatus":"PUBLISHED","skills":["OOP","JavaScript","Programming","Interview"],"languages":["ru","en","ua"],"category":"Programming"}
